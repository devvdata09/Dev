Question 1 : The study underscores the critical role of riparian vegetation, sediment types, and aquatic vegetation in shaping benthic community dynamics. Forested and wetland zones, along with areas featuring coarser sediments and diverse aquatic vegetation, emerged as key contributors to higher benthic diversity and abundance.

Efforts to conserve and restore forested and wetland riparian zones are essential for maintaining and enhancing benthic biodiversity. The findings also highlight the importance of preserving coarser substrates and supporting aquatic vegetation like filamentous algae and submergent macrophytes to foster robust aquatic ecosystems.

Future studies should explore the complex interactions between these factors and additional environmental variables to refine conservation strategies and better understand the ecological drivers of benthic community dynamics.

Question 2: The PCA analysis effectively reduces the dataset's complexity, identifying key environmental drivers of benthic diversity. PC1 and PC2, accounting for most of the variance, allow for a focused exploration of influential variables. Correlations among pH, conductivity, and other factors provide a clearer understanding of environmental interdependencies, aiding in ecosystem assessment. These findings facilitate targeted conservation efforts and a deeper understanding of ecological dynamics in the studied lakes.

Question 3: The analysis confirms that environmental conditions differ significantly across lakes, influencing benthic diversity in distinct ways. PERMANOVA validates these variations, while visualizations highlight conductivity as a key variable with substantial inter-lake differences. Lakes with overlapping environmental characteristics may indicate transitional ecosystems, while isolated lakes demonstrate unique ecological dynamics. These findings provide a foundation for focused environmental management and conservation efforts, ensuring protection of lake ecosystems and their biodiversity by addressing specific environmental drivers.

Question 4 : This analysis underscores the critical role of pH in shaping benthic diversity, with pH categories showing significant differences in community composition. While dissolved oxygen and conductivity were not significant factors, their potential influence should not be ruled out, and further research could explore their interactions with other ecological variables. The absence of significant differences between headwater and non-headwater lakes suggests that factors beyond lake classification, such as riparian zones or nutrient availability, might be driving diversity patterns. Future studies could focus on these aspects to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the ecological drivers of benthic community structure.
