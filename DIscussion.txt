Question 1 : The analysis reveals that riparian vegetation significantly influences benthic community numbers and diversity. Forested and wetland zones are particularly supportive of benthic organisms due to their complex microhabitats, abundant organic matter, and diverse vegetation types. These zones exhibited higher variability and occasionally extreme benthic numbers, suggesting dynamic ecological conditions that foster biodiversity.

Conversely, meadow, scrubland, and lawn zones offer more stable but less diverse conditions. Their uniform habitat characteristics provide consistent support for benthic organisms, albeit with fewer extremes in community numbers. This consistency may be beneficial for specific species but limits overall diversity compared to forested and wetland zones.

The influence of sediment type on benthic communities was also evident. Coarser substrates such as gravel and sand supported higher benthic numbers and diversity, likely due to better oxygenation and reduced compaction. These conditions create favorable habitats for a variety of species, contributing to ecological richness in these areas.

The presence of algae and macrophytes positively correlated with benthic diversity. Filamentous algae and submergent macrophytes, in particular, were associated with higher benthic numbers, indicating their role in providing food and shelter. However, floating algae were observed to potentially limit diversity, suggesting that the type of aquatic vegetation has a nuanced impact on benthic communities.

Water quality parameters such as pH and conductivity emerged as critical factors in predicting benthic numbers, with both showing strong positive relationships. These findings emphasize the interplay between chemical and physical environmental conditions in shaping aquatic ecosystems. The importance of pH and conductivity, alongside vegetation and sediment characteristics, highlights the multifaceted nature of factors influencing benthic communities.

Question 2 : The PCA results reveal that PC1 and PC2 capture approximately 70% of the variance in the dataset, highlighting their importance in summarizing the data's variability. Environmental factors such as pH and conductivity are positively correlated, as evidenced by their alignment in the biplot. Dissolved oxygen, with its distinct direction, indicates it contributes uniquely to the variance. These insights underscore the multidimensional nature of environmental influences on benthic diversity, emphasizing the varying roles of temperature, pH, conductivity, and DO in shaping ecological patterns across lake sites.

Question 3: The PERMANOVA results highlight significant environmental variation among the lakes, confirmed by a low p-value (0.001) and a high pseudo-F statistic (119.20). These findings suggest that unique ecological factors in each lake strongly influence benthic macroinvertebrate diversity. Boxplots and pairplots reveal distinct patterns in conductivity, pH, and temperature, with some lakes exhibiting higher variability or unique clustering. The positive correlation between conductivity and pH in certain lakes suggests shared environmental processes. These results demonstrate that environmental heterogeneity among lakes plays a critical role in shaping ecological communities, emphasizing the need for targeted conservation strategies based on lake-specific conditions.

Question 4: The results of the Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA tests suggest that pH is the primary chemical factor influencing benthic diversity in this dataset. While no significant differences were observed for Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and Conductivity, pH showed a statistically significant relationship with benthic diversity. This highlights the importance of pH in shaping benthic communities, likely due to its impact on the chemical environment and species adaptability. The weak negative trends observed between pH, conductivity, and diversity indicate that extreme chemical conditions may reduce diversity, but these effects are subtle and other environmental factors, such as habitat complexity or nutrient availability, may be playing a larger role. The lack of significant differences between headwater and non-headwater lakes suggests that benthic diversity is more influenced by chemical parameters than by lake type in this study. The variability in diversity across different chemical conditions emphasizes the complexity of aquatic ecosystems, where multiple factors interact to influence species composition.
